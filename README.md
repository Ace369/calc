# Calc - calculator implementation in python

Calculator provides basic math functions like:

    * add - adds all the numbers provided on the command line
    * subtract - subtracts all the numbers from the first number on the command line
    * multiply - multiplies all the number provided on the command line
    * divide - divides the first number with all other numbers on the command line

The calculator program is written in such a way that new
functions can be added to the original program. Whenever
